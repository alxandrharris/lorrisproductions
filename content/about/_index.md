### The Journey Begins

*Lorris Productions* is a film and television production company born out of the love for good storytelling and an appreciation of its power to change the world and bring us together. Our focus is on telling excellent stories with a global appeal.

Our first slate of projects is focused on captivating stories from Asia and the West. With several projects in development, we look forward to bringing these to audiences in the coming years.

We believe there is a large underserved market of people interested in the kinds of unique projects we are working on, and we cannot wait to share them with the world!
