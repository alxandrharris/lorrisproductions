## I'm pleased to formally announce our new production company, *Lorris Productions LLC*. 

### The Start of a Journey

*Lorris Productions* may be a new film and television production company, but its creation has been long in the making. For nearly two decades, we have been collecting stories that we hoped would one day be seen in cinemas, living rooms, or even on Broadway stages.

There has never been a better time than now to launch *Lorris Productions*, as the content we are developing embodies the qualities you expect to see in today's global world.

### Where We're Going

> Over the next several years, our plan is to focus on projects involving Asia and the West.

Asia has been a significant part of my life and this company. Even our company's name, "Lorris," comes from combining my last name, *Harris*, with my husband's, *Lo* (ç¾…).

After years of wondering why there have been virtually no Hollywood stories featuring Asian actors or themes, we have finally started to see some incredible films and series emerge as critical and commercial successes. Films like *Crazy Rich Asians*, *Parasite*, *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, among many others, have made us realize that now is the time to share our stories with audiences.

### In Conclusion

As most people know, the world of independent filmmaking is a long and challenging process. Like so many before us, we're embarking on the fool's journey with confidence and excitement for what lies ahead.
