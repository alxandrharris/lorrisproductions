      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to formally announce our new production company, Lorris Productions LLC. The Start of a Journey Lorris Productions may be a new film and television production company, but its creation has been long in the making. For nearly two decades, we have been collecting stories that we hoped would one day be seen in cinemas, living rooms, or even on Broadway stages.&#xA;There has never been a better time than now to launch Lorris Productions, as the content we are developing embodies the qualities you expect to see in today&amp;rsquo;s global world.</description>
